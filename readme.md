# Retro Hanoi

Retro Hanoi is an adaptation of an age-old puzzle, 'Tower of Hanoi'. Styled to feel like an 80's arcade game, Retro Hanoi is easy to play but quickly scales to an impossible challenge.

## Getting Started

Visit the [game](https://oppnheimer.github.io/retro-Hanoi/)

or

install locally.

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:OppNHeimer/retro-Hanoi.git
$ open index.html
```

## A little more about Retro Hanoi

Retro Hanoi was created as an exercise to practice basic DOM manipulation using JavaScript and jQuery. The game was built in only a few days after only a few weeks of experience writing code.

## Technologies Used

Retro Hanoi is a single page site built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.

## Next Steps

As Retro Hanoi was built with very little programming experience, it needs a cleanup. While the game functions very well, the current code is not totally DRY and is hacked together in places.
