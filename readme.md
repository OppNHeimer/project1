# Retro Hanoi

Retro Hanoi is an adaptation of an age-old puzzle, 'Tower of Hanoi'. Styled to feel like an 80's arcade game, Retro Hanoi is easy to play but quickly scales to an impossible challenge. The game includes small animations that provide hints and visual effect.

## Getting Started

Visit the [game](https://oppnheimer.github.io/retro-Hanoi/)

or

install locally.

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:OppNHeimer/retro-Hanoi.git
$ open index.html
```

## Game Play

### Goal

Restack the tower on a different platform.

Make the game more challenging by starting with a taller tower. Try to solve the puzzle in the fewest possible moves.

### How to

Click to select a tower block.
Click above a different platform to move the block.

### Rules

Only the top block of a tower may be selected.
A block cannot be moved atop a smaller block.

## A little more about Retro Hanoi

Retro Hanoi was created as an exercise to practice basic DOM manipulation using JavaScript and jQuery. The game was built in only a few days after only a few weeks of experience writing code. 

## Technologies Used

Retro Hanoi is a single page site built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.

## Next Steps

As Retro Hanoi was built with very little programming experience, it needs a cleanup. While the game functions very well, the current code is not totally DRY and is hacked together in places.
